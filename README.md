This is my first react app I want to add an extension to my blog, yneedthis.com

Reason behind the project I love fashion and more I like search the web for modest fashion pieces that are on sale. I could have used my blog to share my finds with my followers. But I want more control. I have my idea how I want to share this, hence, by coding it I can able to do so. As such, I develop the looks and when I need to add items to the page, I do not have to worry about the looks because I would have done take care of that. Instead, I will add my data to json file and have my app make reference to the file. Here I can able to showcases fashion pieces anytime how I wanted.

I went the react route because I wanted to learn react.

This is version 1 of this app but later down I will add more feature.

To used npm install npm run start:dev npm run build
